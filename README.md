# ðŸ‘¶ Pacifier ðŸ’¤

ðŸ‘¶PacifierðŸ’¤
 is a tool for converting the melody of any song into a lullaby to put your baby to sleep. For a quickstart demo on how to use ðŸ‘¶ Pacifier ðŸ’¤, have a look
at [this notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/mbuccoli/tsoai-lullaby/blob/main/demo.ipynb).

It was developed by [Bryan](https://github.com/Fenchpress), [Chi-Chun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chi-chun-luo-7714a8213/), [Marta](https://github.com/mmosc), and [Mike](https://mbuccoli.github.io/) 
as a project for
the [1st The Sound of AI Hackaton](https://musikalkemist.github.io/thesoundofaihackathon/).

## Requirements

To use ðŸ‘¶PacifierðŸ’¤, first create a virtual environment by typing

```
python3 -m  venv lullaby-venv
```

and then install the required packages as

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install the following packages to your virtual environment (and dependencies thereof):

- [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [scipy](https://scipy.org/)
- [ipykernel](https://pypi.org/project/ipykernel/)
- [pretty_midi](https://craffel.github.io/pretty-midi/)
- [spleeter](https://research.deezer.com/projects/spleeter.html)
- [basic-pitch](https://basicpitch.spotify.com/)
- [soundfile](http://soundfile.sapp.org/)

You also need to have `ffmpeg`, `libsndfile`, and `sox` installed on your computer.
Additionally, the first time you run ðŸ‘¶PacifierðŸ’¤, it needs download the spleeter pre-trained model
for isolating the melody. Those will be stored in a subfolder named `pretrained_models`.

## Pipeline

The conversion to lullaby consists of several steps:

- Separating the melody from the accompaniment with [spleeter](https://research.deezer.com/projects/spleeter.html)
- Converting the melody to midi with [basic pitch](https://basicpitch.spotify.com/)
- Slow-down the melody
- Synthesize the melody
- Add post-processing effect (low-pass filter, reverb, wave effects)

## Tutorial and general usage

For a quickstart demo on how to use ðŸ‘¶PacifierðŸ’¤, have a look
at [this notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/mbuccoli/tsoai-lullaby/blob/main/demo.ipynb)

ðŸ‘¶PacifierðŸ’¤ converts `.wav`, `.mp3`, and `.mid` files. To turn a song into a lullaby, run

```shell
python3 pycifier_prototype.py --input_audio=<PATH_TO_YOUR_SONG>
```

This will execute ðŸ‘¶PacifierðŸ’¤ with its default parameters. Additionally, you can customize
the conversion parameters by passing the following optional arguments:

| Parameter                                         | Command |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Note onset threshold (`float`=`0.6`)                |       `--onset_threshold` |
| Minimum note length (`int`=`58`)                    |     `--minimum_note_length` |
| Minimum note frequency (Optional[`float`]=`None`) |    `--minimum_frequency` |
| Maximum note frequency(Optional[`float`]=`None`)  |     `--maximum_frequency` |
| Include pitch bends (`bool`=`None`)               |    `--include_pitch_bends` |
| Slowdown rate (`float`=`2.0`)                     |     `--slowdown_rate`   |

By default, ðŸ‘¶PacifierðŸ’¤ will create several additional files in the folder where the original audio is stored. The final 
lullaby is stored in the very same directory, with the name `lullaby_final.wav`. Additionally, files from the intermediate 
steps are stored, so feel free to explore them to investigate the individual steps!

## Contribute
There are many ways in which you can contribute to ðŸ‘¶PacifierðŸ’¤! As a rule of thumb, first have a look at the issue to 
check which ones are open. We are still in the development/brainstorming process, so the issues are nonexhaustive and, 
of course, we are open to suggestions!
